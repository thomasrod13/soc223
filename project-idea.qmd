## Idea

I am interested in looking at the gameshow Jeopardy! I would want to look at how predictive a category is in determining whether contestants know the answer to the question. In a sense, which category types are more difficult than others. This is interesting to me to understand what categories may be more important to study if I (or someone) were to want to go on the show.
